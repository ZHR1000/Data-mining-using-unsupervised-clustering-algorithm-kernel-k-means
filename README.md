# Data-mining-using-unsupervised-clustering-algorithm-kernel-k-means
Data mining  is the technique that discovers previously unknown relationships in data.
Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It deals with finding a structure in a collection of unlabeled data.
The kernel k-means algorithm applies the same trick as k-means but with one difference that here in the calculation of distance, kernel method is used instead of the Euclidean distance.

Software Requirements:
1) Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scipy)
2) PyCharm
